Creamsicle is a Rainmeter skin that displays realtime hardware values!

Why use it?
Utilizing Rainmeter the values can be displayed
in a nice fashion as well as very discrete values
such as specific core voltages may be read using
HWiNFO!

Dependicies:
Rainmeter: https://www.rainmeter.net/
HWiNFO64: https://www.hwinfo.com/download.php

Hopefully not many, but depending on your hardware setup
variables may need to be changed to work properly.
To do so modify the values in the HWiNFO.inc with the values 
in the HWiNFOSharedMemoryViewer. This may take some digging around.

Example:
I want to read the clock speed of my cpu's second core.
In HWiNFOSharedMemoryViewer I find my CPU, and Core #1 Clock:
Here we see the CPU's ID and Instance, as well as Core #1's 
ID, Type, Units, Current, Minimum, Maximum, Average
Modify the values in HWiNFO.inc appropriately:
These values may be different for you!
CPU0-SID=0xf0000300
CPU0-SIN=0x0
CPU0-COR1-CLK=0x6000001

Then in CPU.inc I make a as meter lookup for ease
[CPU0_COR1_CLK]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=HWiNFO.dll
HWiNFOSensorID=#CPU0-SID#
HWiNFOSensorInstance=#CPU0-SIN#
HWiNFOEntryId=#CPU0-COR1-CLK#
HWiNFOType=CurrentValue

Then have another meter display it when it's used
[Meter_CPU0_COR1_CLK]
Meter=String
MeasureName=CPU0_COR1_CLK
Text="%1"
